                       Amazon Software License
                      http://aws.amazon.com/asl/

This Amazon Software License ("License") governs your use, reproduction, and distribution of the accompanying
software as specified below.

1. Definitions

   "Licensor" means any person or entity that distributes its Work.

   "Software" means the original work of authorship made available under this License.
 
   "Work" means the Software and any additions to or derivative works of the Software that are made available 
   under this License.

   The terms "reproduce," "reproduction," "derivative works," and "distribution" have the meaning as provided 
   under U.S. copyright law; provided, however, that for the purposes of this License, derivative works shall 
   not include works that remain separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of, the Work.

   Works, including the Software, are "made available" under this License by including in or with the Work either 
   (a) a copyright notice referencing the applicability of this License to the Work, or (b) a copy of this License.

2. License Grants

   2.1 Copyright Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Licensor grants to you a 
       perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works 
       of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense and distribute its Work and any resulting derivative works 
       in any form.

   2.2 Patent Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Licensor grants to you a perpetual, 
       worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free patent license to make, have made, use, sell, offer for sale, import, 
       and otherwise transfer its Work, in whole or in part. The foregoing license applies only to the patent claims 
       licensable by Licensor that would be infringed by Licensor's Work (or portion thereof) individually and 
       excluding any combinations with any other materials or technology.

3. Limitations

   3.1 Redistribution. You may reproduce or distribute the Work only if (a) you do so under this License, (b) you 
       include a complete copy of this License with your distribution, and (c) you retain without modification any 
       copyright, patent, trademark, or attribution notices that are present in the Work.

   3.2 Derivative Works. You may specify that additional or different terms apply to the use, reproduction, and 
       distribution of your derivative works of the Work ("Your Terms") only if (a) Your Terms provide that the use 
       limitation in Section 3.3 applies to your derivative works, and (b) you identify the specific derivative 
       works that are subject to Your Terms. Notwithstanding Your Terms, this License (including the redistribution 
       requirements in Section 3.1) will continue to apply to the Work itself.

   3.3 Use Limitation. The Work and any derivative works thereof only may be used or intended for use with the web 
       services, computing platforms or applications provided by Amazon.com, Inc. or its affiliates, including Amazon 
       Web Services LLC.

   3.4 Patent Claims. If you bring or threaten to bring a patent claim against any Licensor (including any claim, 
       cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) to enforce any patents that you allege are infringed by any Work, 
       then your rights under this License from such Licensor (including the grants in Sections 2.1 and 2.2) will 
       terminate immediately.

   3.5 Trademarks. This License does not grant any rights to use any Licensor's or its affiliates' names, logos, or 
       trademarks, except as necessary to reproduce the notices described in this License.

   3.6 Termination. If you violate any term of this License, then your rights under this License (including the 
       grants in Sections 2.1 and 2.2) will terminate immediately.

4. Disclaimer of Warranty.
   
   THE WORK IS PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING 
   WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF M ERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT. YOU 
   BEAR THE RISK OF UNDERTAKING ANY ACTIVITIES UNDER THIS LICENSE. SOME STATES' CONSUMER LAWS DO NOT ALLOW EXCLUSION 
   OF AN IMPLIED WARRANTY, SO THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

5. Limitation of Liability.
   
   EXCEPT AS PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER IN TORT (INCLUDING 
   NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE SHALL ANY LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY DIRECT, 
   INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS LICENSE, THE USE OR 
   INABILITY TO USE THE WORK (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF GOODWILL, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, LOST PROFITS OR 
   DATA, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY OTHER COMM ERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES), EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN 
   ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
